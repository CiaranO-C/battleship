## Overview  
This is a classic Battleship game built using vanilla JavaScript and CSS, created as one of my earlier projects while learning web development. The game is fully functional, featuring interactive gameplay against a computer opponent with basic AI (lots of if else!), or a local two player mode. Players can position their ships, attack their opponent, and aim to sink all the enemy ships to win.  

## Takeaways and Improvements
This project was a great opportunity to dive into building an browser-based game from scratch. However, as I've grown as a developer, I've identified areas where it could be improved. To highlight this, I've left the original code untouched on the main branch as an example of my earlier work.  

A more organised and structured version of the code will be displayed on the **battleship-improved** branch.

### What I've Learnt
- **The importance of code organisation:** This project was a pivotal moment where I realised the value of cleaner, more modular code; not by practicing it, but by experiencing the challenges that arose from doing otherwise! Modular code is a necessity, to be able to debug, test, maintain or collaborate with others.
- **Balancing functionality and readability:** While the game works as intended, clearer function naming, better commenting, and consistent formatting go a long way in making the code more immediately understandable, whether to others or yourself when revisiting old code.

### What I'd do differently 
- **Break down the code:** Refactor very large files into smaller modules, ideally as I go along! leaving this task until the end turns it into a more significant challenge, often breaking things as you go. *(e.g. separating game logic, Computer player logic, and UI updates)*.
- **Spend longer planning:** Taking more time upfront to plan the structure and flow of the game would have saved time and effort in the long run, making the code easier to maintain and improve. Furthermore, I believe with a clearer direction the challenges of readability are easier to tackle, as you have a game plan to refer back to.

## Why Include This Project?
Despite the original code being a bit messy, hard for others... or even myself to follow, it serves as a milestone in my journey, highlighting things about me as a developer:
- A willingness to reflect on earlier decisions and identify areas for improvement as my skills have grown.
- My progression from writing monolithic code, to a more modular and maintainable approach.
- An understanding of foundational JavaScript and CSS concepts, which laid the groundwork for more advanced projects.
